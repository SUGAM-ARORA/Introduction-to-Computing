 Q3 For a=56 and b=10 with the help of bitwise operators calculate the following
a. & b=  8
b. | b=  58
c. ^ b=  50
d.\Left shift both a and b with 2 bits : a=  224 b=  40
e.\Right shift a with 2 bits and b with 4 bits : a=  14 b=  0
 Q4 Write a python program to find the greatest of three numbers entered by the user.

 Q6 For any three lengths, there is a simple test to see if it is possible to form a triangle. If any of the three lengths is greater than the sum of the other two,then you cannot form a triangle. Otherwise, Enter three sides of a triangle, converts them to integers, and to check whether the given input lengths can form a triangle or not (Print : “Yes” or “No”) 
Enter 1st length : 12
Enter 2nd length : 10
Enter 3rd length : 15
Yes
